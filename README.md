# CNN Waste Classification

## Overview

This project was created for the my machine learning course (DATASCI 3ML3) at McMaster University. It involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify waste into organic and recyclable materials. The project employs advanced deep learning techniques and data augmentation to improve the model's accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains 22,500 images of organic and recyclable materials. The data is preprocessed to a uniform size of 223x223x3 pixels and split into training (85%) and test (15%) sets.

## Results
The final model achieved a test accuracy of 91.4% using the InceptionV3 architecture and 90.3% using the Xception architecture. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, and zooming were used to improve generalization.
